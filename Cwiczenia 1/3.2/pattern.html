                <h1>Pattern matching</h1>
                <br>
                This chapter will cover some of Haskell's cool syntactic constructs and we'll start with pattern matching. Pattern matching consists of specifying patterns to which some data should conform and then checking to see if it does and deconstructing the data according to those patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                When defining functions, you can define separate function bodies for different patterns. This leads to really neat code that's simple and readable. You can pattern match on any data type — numbers, characters, lists, tuples, etc. Let's make a really trivial function that checks if the number we supplied to it is a seven or not.
                <br>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>lucky :: (Integral a) => a -> String
lucky 7 = "LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN!"
lucky x = "Sorry, you're out of luck, pal!"</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    When you call "lucky", the patterns will be checked from top to bottom and when it conforms to a pattern, the corresponding function body will be used. The only way a number can conform to the first pattern here is if it is 7. If it's not, it falls through to the second pattern, which matches anything and binds it to "x". This function could have also been implemented by using an if statement.
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    But what if we wanted a function that says the numbers from 1 to 5 and says "Not between 1 and 5" for any other number? Without pattern matching, we'd have to make a pretty convoluted if then else tree. However, with it:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>sayMe :: (Integral a) => a -> String
sayMe 1 = "One!"
sayMe 2 = "Two!"
sayMe 3 = "Three!"
sayMe 4 = "Four!"
sayMe 5 = "Five!"
sayMe x = "Not between 1 and 5"</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                Note that if we moved the last pattern (the catch-all one) to the top, it would always say "Not between 1 and 5", because it would catch all the numbers and they wouldn't have a chance to fall through and be checked for any other patterns.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Remember the factorial function we implemented previously? We defined the factorial of a number "n" as "product [1..n]". We can also define a factorial function recursively, the way it is usually defined in mathematics. We start by saying that the factorial of 0 is 1. Then we state that the factorial of any positive integer is that integer multiplied by the factorial of its predecessor. Here's how that looks like translated in Haskell terms.
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                This is the first time we've defined a function recursively. Recursion is important in Haskell and we'll take a closer look at it later. But in a nutshell, this is what happens if we try to get the factorial of, say, 3. It tries to compute "3 * factorial 2". The factorial of 2 is "2 * factorial 1", so for now we have "3 * (2 * factorial 1)". "factorial 1" is "1 * factorial 0", so we have "3 * (2 * (1 * factorial 0))". Now here comes the trick — we've defined the factorial of 0 to be just 1 and because it encounters that pattern before the catch-all one, it just returns 1. So the final result is equivalent to "3 * (2 * (1 * 1))". Had we written the second pattern on top of the first one, it would catch all numbers, including 0 and our calculation would never terminate. That's why order is important when specifying patterns and it's always best to specify the most specific ones first and then the more general ones later.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Pattern matching can also fail. If we define a function like this:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>charName :: Char -> String
charName 'a' = "Albert"
charName 'b' = "Broseph"
charName 'c' = "Cecil"</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    and then try to call it with an input that we didn't expect, this is what happens:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>ghci> charName 'a'
"Albert"
ghci> charName 'b'
"Broseph"
ghci> charName 'h'
"*** Exception: tut.hs:(53,0)-(55,21): Non-exhaustive patterns in function charName</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                It complains that we have non-exhaustive patterns, and rightfully so. When making patterns, we should always include a catch-all pattern so that our program doesn't crash if we get some unexpected input.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Pattern matching can also be used on tuples. What if we wanted to make a function that takes two vectors in a 2D space (that are in the form of pairs) and adds them together? To add together two vectors, we add their x components separately and then their y components separately. Here's how we would have done it if we didn't know about pattern matching:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>addVectors :: (Num a) => (a, a) -> (a, a) -> (a, a)
addVectors a b = (fst a + fst b, snd a + snd b)  </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Well, that works, but there's a better way to do it. Let's modify the function so that it uses pattern matching.
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>addVectors :: (Num a) => (a, a) -> (a, a) -> (a, a)
addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)  </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                There we go! Much better. Note that this is already a catch-all pattern. The type of "addVectors" (in both cases) is "addVectors :: (Num a) => (a, a) -> (a, a) - > (a, a)", so we are guaranteed to get two pairs as parameters.
                <br>
                <br>
                "fst" and "snd" extract the components of pairs. But what about triples? Well, there are no provided functions that do that but we can make our own.
                <br>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>first :: (a, b, c) -> a
first (x, _, _) = x

second :: (a, b, c) -> b
second (_, y, _) = y

third :: (a, b, c) -> c
third (_, _, z) = z  </pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    The "_" means the same thing as it does in list comprehensions. It means that we really don't care what that part is, so we just write a "_".
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Which reminds me, you can also pattern match in list comprehensions. Check this out:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>ghci> let xs = [(1,3), (4,3), (2,4), (5,3), (5,6), (3,1)]
ghci> [a+b | (a,b) <- xs]
[4,7,6,8,11,4]   </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                Should a pattern match fail, it will just move on to the next element.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lists themselves can also be used in pattern matching. You can match with the empty list "[]" or any pattern that involves : and the empty list. But since "[1,2,3]" is just syntactic sugar for "1:2:3:[]", you can also use the former pattern. A pattern like "x:xs" will bind the head of the list to "x" and the rest of it to "xs", even if there's only one element so "xs" ends up being an empty list.
                <br>
                <br>
                <mark>
                    Note: The "x:xs" pattern is used a lot, especially with recursive functions. But patterns that have : in them only match against lists of length 1 or more.
                </mark>
                <br>
                If you want to bind, say, the first three elements to variables and the rest of the list to another variable, you can use something like "x:y:z:zs". It will only match against lists that have three elements or more.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Now that we know how to pattern match against list, let's make our own implementation of the "head" function.
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>head' :: [a] -> a
head' [] = error "Can't call head on an empty list, dummy!"
head' (x:_) = x </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Checking if it works:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>ghci> head' [4,5,6]
4
ghci> head' "Hello"
'H'  </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                Nice! Notice that if you want to bind to several variables (even if one of them is just "_" and doesn't actually bind at all), we have to surround them in parentheses. Also notice the "error" function that we used. It takes a string and generates a runtime error, using that string as information about what kind of error occurred. It causes the program to crash, so it's not good to use it too much. But calling "head" on an empty list doesn't make sense.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Let's make a trivial function that tells us some of the first elements of the list in (in)convenient English form.
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>tell :: (Show a) => [a] -> String
tell [] = "The list is empty"
tell (x:[]) = "The list has one element: " ++ show x
tell (x:y:[]) = "The list has two elements: " ++ show x ++ " and " ++ show y
tell (x:y:_) = "This list is long. The first two elements are: " ++ show x ++ " and " ++ show y</pre>

            <br>
            <div class="row">
                This function is safe because it takes care of the empty list, a singleton list, a list with two elements and a list with more than two elements. Note that "(x:[])" and "(x:y:[])" could be rewriten as "[x]" and "[x,y]" (because its syntatic sugar, we don't need the parentheses). We can't rewrite "(x:y:_)" with square brackets because it matches any list of length 2 or more.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    We already implemented our own "length" function using list comprehension. Now we'll do it by using pattern matching and a little recursion:
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>length' :: (Num b) => [a] -> b
length' [] = 0
length' (_:xs) = 1 + length' xs  </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                This is similar to the factorial function we wrote earlier. First we defined the result of a known input — the empty list. This is also known as the edge condition. Then in the second pattern we take the list apart by splitting it into a head and a tail. We say that the length is equal to 1 plus the length of the tail. We use "_" to match the head because we don't actually care what it is. Also note that we've taken care of all possible patterns of a list. The first pattern matches an empty list and the second one matches anything that isn't an empty list.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's see what happens if we call "length'" on "ham". First, it will check if it's an empty list. Because it isn't, it falls through to the second pattern. It matches on the second pattern and there it says that the length is "1 + length' "am"", because we broke it into a head and a tail and discarded the head. O-kay. The "length'" of "am" is, similarly, "1 + length' "m"". So right now we have "1 + (1 + length' "m")". "length' "m"" is "1 + length' """ (could also be written as "1 + length' []"). And we've defined "length' []" to be "0". So in the end we have "1 + (1 + (1 + 0))".
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    Let's implement "sum". We know that the sum of an empty list is 0. We write that down as a pattern. And we also know that the sum of a list is the head plus the sum of the rest of the list. So if we write that down, we get:                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>sum' :: (Num a) => [a] -> a
sum' [] = 0
sum' (x:xs) = x + sum' xs </pre>

            <div class="row">
                There's also a thing called as patterns. Those are a handy way of breaking something up according to a pattern and binding it to names whilst still keeping a reference to the whole thing. You do that by putting a name and an "@" in front of a pattern. For instance, the pattern "xs@(x:y:ys)". This pattern will match exactly the same thing as "x:y:ys" but you can easily get the whole list via "xs" instead of repeating yourself by typing out "x:y:ys" in the function body again. Here's a quick and dirty example:
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>capital :: String -> String
capital "" = "Empty string, whoops!"
capital all@(x:xs) = "The first letter of " ++ all ++ " is " ++ [x]  </pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 card">
                    <pre>ghci> capital "Dracula"
"The first letter of Dracula is D"  </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>

                Normally we use as patterns to avoid repeating ourselves when matching against a bigger pattern when we have to use the whole thing again in the function body.

                One more thing — you can't use "++" in pattern matches. If you tried to pattern match against "(xs ++ ys)", what would be in the first and what would be in the second list? It doesn't make much sense. It would make sense to match stuff against "(xs ++ [x,y,z])" or just "(xs ++ [x])", but because of the nature of lists, you can't do that.
